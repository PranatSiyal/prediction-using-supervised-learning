# prediction-using-supervised-learning
This repository consists of linear regression with scikit-learn
Here in this supervised machine learning model, we use linear regression to predict scores of student based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task involving only 2 variables.
This repo consists of 2 subfolders for linear regression and supervised machine learning. Each subfolder has its own instruction on how to run.
